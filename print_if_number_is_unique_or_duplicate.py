# Initialize an empty set to keep track of unique numbers
# Using a while True loop
# -> try asking for a valid number input
# -> if the input is valid
#   -> check if the number is the set
#   -> if the number is found in the set print "Duplicate"
#   -> otherwise, print "Unique" and add it to the set
# -> if the input is invalid, break out of the loop and stop the program
