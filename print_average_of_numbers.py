# Initialize a list to store all inputted numbers
# Create an infinite loop using a while True statement
# Inside the loop, ask the user for a number with a try/except block to handle invalid inputs
# If the input is valid then add the number to the list
# Otherwise, break out of the while loop
# Calculate the average by using the sum() method to find the sum of all the numbers and len() to find the number of elements in the list
# Print the average
