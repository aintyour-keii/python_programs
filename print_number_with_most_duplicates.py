# Initiate a dictionary to store all inputted numbers
# Create an infinite loop using a while True loop
# Inside the loop:
# Using try/except block to catch any potential errors
# Ask for a number input
# If it is a valid input, check if it is in the dictionary and add one to its value 
# otherwise add it to the dictionary with a value of 1
# If the input is invalid break out of the loop
# Initiate a variable to store the input with the most number of repetition
# Loop throught the dictionary and identify the input with the most number of repetition
# Print the variable that stores the input with the most number of repetition
