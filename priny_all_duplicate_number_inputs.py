# Initialize a dictionary to store all the number inputs
# Loop 10 times using a for loop
# -> Ask for a number input
# -> If the number exists in the dictionary, increment its value by 1
# -> Otherwise, add the number in the dictionary with a count of 1
# Initialize a list to store all the duplicated numbers
# Loop through the dictionary and add the number with a value of greater than 1 to the list
# Print the list that stores all the numbers that was inputted more than once
