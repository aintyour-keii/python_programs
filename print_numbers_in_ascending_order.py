# Initialize an empty list to store all inputted numbers
# Continuously ask for a number input using a while True loop
# Check if the input is valid using try/except
# If the input is valid append the input to the list
# Otherwise break out of the loop
# Check if there were any valid inputs by checking on the list
# If there were valid inputs, using the sort method, sort the list in ascending order
# Print the sorted list
